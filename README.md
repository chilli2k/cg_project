####Here we visualize the activities carried out by the worker honey bee in a day.
 These activities may include fetching nectar from the flower to
flying back to the beehive or flying from one flower to another
flower and flying to and from the beehive.
##### When it is night or the time with lower light or no sun, then the
honey bee will be in the beehive.
 We are making use of the OpenGL primitives like,
 GL_POINTS
 GL_LINE_LOOP
 GL_MODELVIEW
 GL_POLYGON
and other useful built-in functions of OpenGL and C language to
exhibit the interaction and simulation of Honey Bees.
